This repo contain two projects, one for configuring OSPF and one for configuring vlans.
both projects prompt the user to enter the specefications for OSPF/vlan without the need to enter any commands.
for example the user can choose the process id and area number for OSPF and the ospf will be created with those specefications, same things with vlan, the user choose the vlans and their names and interfaces and they'll be created automatically.
if you have any notes or improvments let me know.
